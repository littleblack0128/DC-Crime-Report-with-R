# DC-Crime-Report-with-R

How to be less exposed to crime? I investigate this question by using a data set called “Crime Incidents in the Last 30 Days”. It contains 2,691 crime reports with locations and attributes of incidents reported by the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department from 11/09/2017 to 12/09/2017. This dataset will help me in exploring this question. 

Safety is always a primary concern for all. The further analysis will benefit residents in DC and visitors who recently are planning to visit DC.
